You're right to ask for clarification! Based on your earlier description, your project is more focused on **predicting bike rental demand using time series forecasting models**, rather than incorporating advanced deep learning models like LSTM. I made an assumption in my initial readme draft. Here's an updated and more accurate README based on your project description:

# Forecast Daily Bike Rental Demand

This project aims to forecast the daily demand for bike rentals using **time series forecasting** techniques. The dataset contains daily bike rental demand along with other influencing features like weather and time of year. The goal is to use this data to predict the future rental demand for better resource planning.

## Project Overview

This project applies traditional **time series forecasting methods** to predict daily bike rental demand. The following steps were involved:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
2. **Model Selection**: We experimented with various classical time series models.
3. **Model Evaluation**: We assessed model performance based on forecasting accuracy.
4. **Visualization**: We included visualization techniques for evaluating and interpreting the results.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bike-rental-demand-forecasting.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd bike-rental-demand-forecasting
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:

   - For Python-based dependencies, install them using `requirements.txt`:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - If you're working with R for some of the analysis, ensure that the following libraries are installed:

     ```R
     install.packages(c("forecast", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tseries"))
     ```

## Usage

### Preprocessing

The data contains information on daily bike rental demand along with several features such as:
- Hour of the day
- Temperature, humidity, and weather conditions
- Weekday/weekend information
- Holiday flags

The preprocessing steps involve:
- Cleaning the data
- Filling or dropping missing values
- Normalizing numerical features

### Model Training

The project uses the following classical time series models:
- **ARIMA** (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **Exponential Smoothing** (Holt-Winters method)

These models are trained using the historical bike rental demand and weather features. The goal is to accurately predict future demand for bike rentals.

### Evaluation

We evaluate the models based on forecasting accuracy using:
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
- **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

The results show which model best captures the underlying trends in the data.

### Running the Code

To run the forecasting model and see the results:

- For Python-based forecasting, execute the following script:

  ```bash
  python forecast_model.py
  ```

- For R-based forecasting:

  ```R
  source('forecast_model.R')
  ```

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains historical bike rental demand and weather-related features such as:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.)
- Weekday/weekend flags
- Holiday flags

The dataset can be found in the `data/` folder or can be linked from an external source.

## Models Used

- **ARIMA**: A widely-used statistical model for time series data that accounts for seasonality and trends.
- **Exponential Smoothing** (Holt-Winters): A technique that smooths the series and handles both seasonality and trends.

## Results

After training the models, we compare their performance using the following metrics:
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**

These metrics help in determining the model that provides the most accurate demand forecasts.
