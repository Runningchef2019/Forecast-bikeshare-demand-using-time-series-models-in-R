# About Data Analysis Report

This RMarkdown file contains the report of the data analysis done for the project on forecasting daily bike rental demand using time series models in R. It contains analysis such as data exploration, summary statistics and building the time series models. The final report was completed on `r date()`. 

**Data Description:**

This dataset contains the daily count of rental bike transactions between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.

**Data Source:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset

# Task Six: Findings and Conclusions

# The findings and conclusions part summarizes the key insights drawn from the analysis and modeling performed on the bike rental data. 
# Here’s a breakdown of what the conclusion is stating:

# Data Processing and ARIMA Modeling:
# The raw data was processed, and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models were used to forecast bike rental patterns.
# The model was applied to predict rentals for the next 25 days beyond the available data.

# Seasonality and Weather Impact:
# The data indicates a seasonal trend where the number of bike rentals increases as the weather gets warmer, which aligns with typical real-world behavior (e.g., more people use bikes in warm weather).

# Annual Trend:
# Over a two-year period, the data shows that the total number of rentals increases year-over-year. This suggests a growing trend in bike rentals, possibly due to factors like improved infrastructure, greater bike-sharing adoption, or increased demand.

# End-of-Cycle Behavior:
# The data terminates at the end of a one-year cycle, and based on the previous trends, the model predicts that rentals will continue to increase as compared to the previous year.

# Oscillation and Long-Term Growth:
# The rentals oscillate (up and down) within a year but with an overall upward trend. The pattern shows that although rentals fluctuate seasonally, the overall trend indicates increasing demand for bike rentals.

# Model Expectations:
# The conclusions match the expected outcome: the data oscillates seasonally, but with an overall upward trajectory in bike rentals.
